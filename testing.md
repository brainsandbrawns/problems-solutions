#### Testing issues and solutions

1. Testing main App component:

```js
describe('<App />', () => {
  it('should render Header component', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
    expect(wrapper.find(Header)).to.have.length(1);
  });
});
```

Test was broken with:

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'propTypes' of undefined
```

**Solution**

This article was helpful: https://kyrisu.com/2016/01/31/unit-testing-react-native-components-with-enzyme-part-1/ which points to https://gist.github.com/jmreidy/4145809229195441d4d4 at the end I have used npm module to mock React-Native components:
https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-native-mock

In test/setup.js which has to run before all your tests, require the module :

```js
// This will mutate `react-native`'s require cache with `react-native-mock`'s.
require('react-native-mock/mock'); // <-- side-effects!!!

```
